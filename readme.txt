Set your EventBrite App Key and organizer ID in the settings.

Use the shortcode "upcoming_events_for_eventbrite" to render the events.
[upcoming_events_for_eventbrite]

Optionally, you can specify the maximum number of events to display using the max_count. Default is 3.
[upcoming_events_for_eventbrite max_count="6"]

This plugin was created for a non-profit at Cleveland GiveCamp 2015.
